    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <section>
        <p>
            I'm Khendo Lama, and I'm passionate about learning both front-end and back-end technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and MongoDB. I enjoy solving problems and creating dynamic, user-friendly web applications. I keep up with emerging trends and tools to continuously improve my skills. I love collaborating with teams and working with new people on exciting projects.

         <p>
            Before diving into web development, I had a wide range of experiences—from babysitting and working as a cashier to managing various odd jobs. Although these roles didn't involve coding, they helped me develop key skills that now define how I approach problem-solving and communication in my development work.
            <br><br>
            Through babysitting, I learned how to handle unpredictable situations with patience and quick thinking. As a cashier, I developed a keen eye for detail, and the ability to work under pressure while ensuring a positive experience for customers. These experiences taught me the importance of clear communication, adaptability, and staying calm in fast-paced environments—qualities that are just as essential in coding as they are in customer service.
            <br><br>
            Now, as a developer, I draw on these lessons every day. I approach each project with empathy for the end user, ensuring I build products that are both functional and user-friendly. I'm passionate about continued learning, and I am excited to keep pushing my skills forward, building applications that solve real-world problems.
